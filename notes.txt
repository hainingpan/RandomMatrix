1.2-d parameter space
2.measure distance of two norm
3.gamma1 vs gamma2 vs height

1. prob is not constant
2. shape of root distribution

3. why always a dip?
4. prob=sqrt(2)
5. divergent when Gamma=1, nY more than 2?

1-10373 ->2

to fill the dip, T need to be determined, where side peak should be determined, so why gamma1 == side peak, in N=4,still works??
