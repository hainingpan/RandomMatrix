1.2-d parameter space
2.measure distance of two norm
3.gamma1 vs gamma2 vs height

1. prob is not constant
2. shape of root distribution

3. why always a dip?
4. prob=sqrt(2)
5. divergent when Gamma=1, nY more than 2?

1-10373 ->2

to fill the dip, T need to be determined, where side peak should be determined, so why gamma1 == side peak, in N=4,still works??

3. alpha phase diagram find purely imaginary eigenvalues,
Also, as a side project, you should produce some figures using your alpha1-alpha2 class D simulations (add alpha3 only if necessary)  where your simulated ZBP phase diagrams look similar to the figures I sent you from Frolov and Kouwenhoven papers yesterday.  You can tune your parameters freely—the idea is to show that figures like the “experimental ZBP phase diagrams” can be easily reproduced theoretically by tuning parameters.  No need to do tuning here to obtain any quantized ZBPs since these experimental phase diagrams are only for ZBPs.
Q: v_bias is not symmetric

see if the local conductance for two leads same as one lead?


+last sentence: the random matrix does not only apply to the nanowire but also apply to any platform where time-reversal symmetry and spin rotational symmetry is broken.
